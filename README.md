# XSLT Content Object

This TYPO3 extension adds a new content object XSLT to the standard TypoScript cObjects. With the XSLT cObject you can retrieve and transform XML data with pure TypoScript and XSL stylesheets. The data can be fetched from database fields, files or external resources.

This is the development repository for cobj_xslt. You can find the official extension releases in the TYPO3 Extension Repository at http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/cobj_xslt

The documentation is at http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/cobj_xslt/
